- Sonya Sawtelle: Wrote a nice and detailed Jupyter-based [blog](https://sdsawtelle.github.io/blog/output/automated-gauge-readout-with-opencv.html) on how to find a needle on an Itron Gas meter and interprete its angle.  The method `def find_needle` described in the blog is made use of in the `gasmeter_analyzer`.
